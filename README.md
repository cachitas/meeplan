# meeplan

A tool to help planning future meetings.

For now, only a converter utility exsits. The workflow for now is to organize
the next meeting dates and speakers in a spreadsheet and then, using the
converter, post it in a DokuWiki page.


## Converter

Converts CSV text to DokuWiki table markup.

### Requirements

Requires Python 3. Uses `tkinter` for the GUI.

### Usage

`python3 converter.py`
